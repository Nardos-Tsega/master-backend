### Task Tracker CLI

A simple command-line task management application built with Python that demonstrates the CRUD mindset (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and a clean, layered backend architecture.

This project is intentionally minimal - using only a JSON file for persistence - so you can focus on understanding how data flows through Models → Repository → Service → CLI.
