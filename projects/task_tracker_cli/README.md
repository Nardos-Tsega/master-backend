# Task Tracker CLI

# https://roadmap.sh/projects/task-tracker**Project URL:\*\* https://roadmap.sh/projects/task-tracker

A simple command-line task management application built with Python that demonstrates the CRUD mindset (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and a clean, layered backend architecture.

This project is intentionally minimal - using only a JSON file for persistence - so you can focus on understanding how data flows through Models â†’ Repository â†’ Service â†’ CLI.
